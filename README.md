# Vehicle Local Motion Planner for Small Obstacles Mitigation


## Description
Off-highway vehicles such as construction and mining vehicles, when driving autonomously, may often encounter unexpected obstacles, big or small. They need to make navigation decisions on the fly to efficiently and safely bypass those obstacles.

By leveraging Navigation Toolbox™ and Stateflow® with MATLAB®, you can design a search-based local motion planner to generate a minimal safe trajectory over an obstacle. This planner can handle a variety of cases including: 
1. Generating a new trajectory to drive over a small obstacle 
2. Generating a trajectory around the obstacle if it is too large
3. Including reverse motion if the obstacle is detected very close to the vehicle
